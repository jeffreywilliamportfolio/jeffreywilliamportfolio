# Jeffrey William - AI Forward Engineer

## Intelligence Architect. Removing friction from logic. Attempting to build what will last.

### Hi, I'm Jeffrey.

I build resilient software systems.

My background is in **System Architecture**, inspired by the engineering principles of precision instrumentation.

#### Current Focus: Signal Lab

https://github.com/jeffreywilliamportfolio/signal-lab-demo-version

I am currently building **Signal Lab**, an agentic swarm research framework designed to reduce "hallucination drift" in LLM outputs. By implementing recursive verification loops, we ensure high-fidelity data processing for complex research workflows. Initial public preview coming very soon.

* **Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, React, OpenAI-Agents SDK
* **Focus:** Autonomous Agents, Recursive Logic, System Stability
