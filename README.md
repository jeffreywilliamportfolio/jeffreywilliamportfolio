# Jeffrey William - AI Forward Engineer

## Intelligence Architect. Removing friction from logic. Attempting to build what will last.

### Hi, I'm Jeffrey.

I build resilient software systems.

My background is in **System Architecture**, inspired by the engineering principles of precision instrumentation (specifically the Fiber Optic Gyroscope, developed by my grandfather, Richard Shorthill).

I apply those same principles—**drift correction, feedback loops, and solid-state design**—to modern software development.

#### Current Focus: Signal Lab
I am currently building **Signal Lab**, an agentic swarm framework designed to reduce "hallucination drift" in LLM outputs. By implementing recursive verification loops, we ensure high-fidelity data processing for complex workflows. Initial public preview coming very soon.

* **Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, Vector Databases
* **Focus:** Autonomous Agents, Recursive Logic, System Stability
